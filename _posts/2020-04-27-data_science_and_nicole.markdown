At a very young age I had a feeling that I would end up in the world of computers. My mom was pregnant with me and in classes for Computer Technologies and I like to think that it helped with the ease of understanding I have when it comes to "tech talk". 

Fast forward to my Junior/Senior year of high school, the tech field was booming and computer science was the field to be in. I always saw myself going into that field but after long nights of research, I found myself doubting the sustainability of a career with that path. It was said that there were too many graduates and not enough jobs. I decided that I did not want to do that to myself and decided to go a different route. I finally settled on Criminal Justice, which was a very lucrative degree and I always wanted to be in the investigative side of things. Upon graduation, I learned that many of my fellow graduates across the state had the same thinking I did. I was lucky enough to already have a position within law enforcement and thought my degree would allow me to advance my career. 

I continued on to higher education where I studied Forensic Psychology. This was very fascinating to me as I like to solve puzzles and figure out what makes people do the things they do. I held some investigative jobs but ultimately ended up in a place where I felt like something was missing.

I found a job after being a stay at home mom for a year and a half, with a computer software company. I quickly grasped the concepts and moved up. I have been with the same company for 6 years but I cannot move forward and knew I needed to do something. My mom recently completed the Software Engineering course and was telling me all about it. I checked out a few boot camps and realized that data science is what has been missing all these years. I currently look at trends, see and predict future issues but without the data or the know-how it becomes words and not facts. 

I decided to get into Data Science because I love numbers, gathering data, looking for trends, predicting the "future" and all things I have researched about data science. Anytime I read an article or something about data science I say, "Yep, that's it, that is what I want." I feel with completing this course and gaining the certification, I will be able to love my work and continue on to the piece that has been missing.
